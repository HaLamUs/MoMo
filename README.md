# MoMo

Hi team iOS - MoMo,

This project I build for applies iOS Developer role to your company.
Inspired by this post https://medium.com/@eggcellent.design/vietnamese-mobile-wallet-momo-redesign-b2e2be8cfded

With product mindset. I try to squeeze out performance by creating views programmatically (not using storyboard).
Also catch up technology with Swift 3.
I know it's not much. But it just starts and I will continue it as my pet project.

Thank you!
